Creating an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL

This application refereces a MySQL database that contains our inventory information.

For the customer view, you first select the ID of the item that you'd like to purchase:

After the id is selected, you must then enter the quantity you wish to purchase:

Once you select your quantity, a message comes back with the total price of the transaction:

If you choose a quantity higher than the remaining inventory left, you will receive an insufficient quantity error:

Please note: this is only for the customer portion of the bamanzon homework.
